# Voicele - Language-based Guessing Game

My Bachelor's Project: a game with interactive and learning elements, as well as the possibility to create a profit by running advertisements on the side. Backend implemented using Django, and its REST Framework to handle API calls and responses. Used Google's AI to perform text-to-speech. Chose React, React Router and MaterialUI for frontend component-based application building, routing and styling. Used Webpack to increase performance and loading speed by bundling files together and Babel to achieve compatibility with older browsers that run ES5.
